I am a seasoned platform specialist with over 15 years of experience in various aspects of software development life cycle. My expertise lies in web stack development, where I have worked on different applications ranging from client applications to web services to websites. I have a proven track record of designing and developing high-quality, scalable software solutions for diverse clients across industries.

As an architect and hands-on developer, I am passionate about writing platform-agnostic, cloud-agnostic code, and designing application architecture from scratch. I have a strong understanding of system and low-level design principles, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering best practices.
